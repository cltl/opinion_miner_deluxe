1 token -2 -1 0

-> The first 1 is the length of the template, in this case unigram
-> Then 'n' labels that will be used (must match with the labels generated
 by the feature extractor)
--> Then the positions, in case of 2grams 3grams each position must be
--> n/m/p

The example would generate these templates:
('token',-2)
('token',-1)
('token',0)


Example with bigrams
2 token token -2/-1 -1/0 0/1 1/2

would generate:
(('token',-2),('token',-1))
(('token',-1),('token',0))
(('token',1),('token',1))


Example with tigrams (the example makes no sense)
3 token lemma pos -2/0/4 9/8/3
(('token',-2),('lemma',0),('pos',4))
(('token',9),('lemma',8),('pos',3))
